# Machine Learning Path

## Description
GloApp will provide explanations about the experienced skin conditions, the causes of the diseases, and how to manage them. Additionally, we also offer a platform for online consultations with doctors for further explanations and treatment.

### Inception V3
Inception V3 is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was developed by Google researchers. It is part of the Inception series of CNN models, which were designed for image classification and object recognition tasks. Inception V3 represents an improvement over its predecessor, Inception V2, by introducing several key innovations.

The main idea behind the Inception architecture is to enhance the network's performance and efficiency by using multiple parallel convolutional layers with different filter sizes. This allows the network to capture information at various scales and resolutions simultaneously, enabling it to learn and recognize complex patterns in images.

### Dataset
We used the 'Skindata' dataset already available on Kaggle. We added and edited the dataset as needed. This dataset contains 12 types of diseases: Acne, Dermatophyte Infection Ringworm, Eczema, Hair Diseases, Insect Bites and Stings, Nail Diseases, Pigmentary Disorders, Skin Cancer, Skin Allergy Urticaria, Vascular Tumors, Vasculitis, Versicolor. And the data must be in jpg format
