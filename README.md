# Cloud Computing Path

Creating **RESTful APIs** and deploying to [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com)
by using [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) and [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute) for communication between **Machine Learning System Model** and **Mobile Development**. And Creating database in [Cloud NoSQL (Mongodb)](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/mongodb/mdb-atlas-self-service?authuser=3&project=gloapp-389203).

# RESTful APIs
In making the **RESTful APIs** we use [Node.js](https://github.com/python) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) using the Framework with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).
